            This webpage was built using Vue.js<br>
            I did this by first installing node.js on my laptop. Now I have npm (Node Package Manager)<br>
            I then installed Vue.js with npm. After I build the webpage by setting up the app.vue, main.js and the index.html<br>
            After I've created the webpage, I use npm to build and it's now avaible in a folder name dist.<br>
            Next I shared in on GitHub via npm, and host it on GitHub pages. I did have to transfer all files before I deploy it though<br>
            Challenges:<br>
            I encountered quite a lot of challenges when attempting this problem, first I didn't understand how I should use Vue.js<br>
            Installing it was fine, however, it was pretty torturing to understand main.js, App.vue and index.html. I had to look at some videos to understand.<br>
            Finally, after I've completed the code, hosting it was another challenge, I had to follow a tutorial step by step, yet still multiple issues occured
             and took me a long time to figure out the solution. Fortunately, I successfully employed it on GitHub pages.
